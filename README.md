# BraveAdventure

## Description 
We want to make robot to observe the unknown maze. There is no knowledge about the maze and so ever. The robot need to observe every side or maze, decide where it go, and back home when is done. Unfortunately, memory size of MCU (in this project we use ATMega2560) is limited. Due to that, we limit the maze size is 60x60. We modelling the maze as Cartesian coordinates. The robot start from the middle (30,30), and move in the maze.

## What we have done?
